# Japan tips

## Overall tips:
- Buy a goshuincho with a design that you like from one of the many book or stationary shops, then make sure to fill it with goshuin from every temple that you find! (https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/japanese-culture/a-beginners-guide-to-goshuincho-how-to-get-one-and-how-to-use-it/)
- Buy a separate goshuincho, and reserve this one for stamps that you can find spread all around Japan! Train stations (https://www.jrailpass.com/blog/eki-train-stamps), shrines, attractions in general, always carry it with you and keep an eye open for opportunities to stamp it!
- Check https://www.jal.co.jp/nl/en/guide-to-japan/plan-your-trip/tips/what-to-know-temple-and-shrine-visit-in-japan.html for some great tips on how to visit temples/shrines and don‚Äôt annoy the locals (also how to make the most out of it, temples and shrines are the number 1 thing to do in Japan after all!)
- Konbini (https://www.japan.travel/en/japan-magazine/2002_konbini/) and jihanki (http://yabai.com/p/4168) are your greatest friends! In case of need, head towards a local, bow and ask ‚Äúsumimasen, konbini/jihanki wa doko desu ka?‚Äù with an upwards intonation in the last syllable, then try to make sense of their gesticulations.
- Always carry cash, including some bills and coins.
- In doubt, look for restaurants that have plastic food models (https://arigatojapan.co.jp/plastic-food-japan/), take a picture of what you want, then show it to the waiter.
- Google Maps is usually very precise within the Tokyo metropolitan area, up to telling you what train cars are the best for a quick connection or closest to the exit you want.
- Get familiar with a handful of characters, for example ÂÖ•Âè£ (entrance), Âá∫Âè£ (exit), Êù±Âè£ (east exit), ÂåóÂè£ (north exit), ÂçóÂè£ (south exit), Ë•øÂè£ (west exit), Êäº (push, for example a door), Âºï (pull in the case of a door, a discount in the case of a product, very common in konbini or in supermarkets at the end of the day), Êñô (fee), ÁÑ°Êñô (free üòâ), ÈõªËªä (train).

## Osaka:
- Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan (https://www.kaiyukan.com/language/eng/) deserves a few hours of your time, take it slow and be hypnotized by the many different specimens. Also make sure to find the several stamp stations to fill your goshuincho!
- Tenpozan Ferris Wheel (https://osaka-info.jp/en/spot/tempozan-ferris-wheel/), near the aquarium, is also a small fun detour.
- Universal Studios Japan (https://www.usj.co.jp/web/en/us) is fun (although I prefer the Disney parks)
- You can skip the Osaka Castle, just take some pictures from outside, the inside is a modern history museum that requires a lot of Japanese to understand (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4000.html)
- Dotonbori street, can‚Äôt miss the street food
- Dotonbori canal, iconic Glico sign (https://www.happyjappy.com/blog/the-glico-running-man.htm) and huge Don Quijote (https://www.donki.com/en/store/shop_detail.php?shop_id=110, excellent to buy cheap souvenirs)
- Try the okonomiyaki („ÅäÂ•Ω„ÅøÁÑº„Åç), takoyaki („Åü„ÅìÁÑº„Åç) and kushikatsu (‰∏≤„Ç´„ÉÑ), more tips in https://insideosaka.com/what-to-eat-in-osaka/
- Eat some the ‚Äúfluffiest‚Äù cheesecake of Japan in http://www.rikuro.co.jp/en/

## Nara:
- The main attraction are the deers. Buy some crackers from street vendors, and be careful with pockets and bags (they will try to reach inside and bite anything, last time they ate my map üòÇ). Don‚Äôt forget to greet them with a bow, it‚Äôs very cute.
- The giant Buddha in the Todaiji temple is very impressive (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4100.html)
- There are multiple temples and shrines all around, take a look at https://japancheapo.com/entertainment/things-to-do-in-nara-day-trip/ and see what interests you most :)
- 1 day should be enough for Nara

## Kyoto:
- Fushimi Inari is a must, but the first two levels are usually super crowded. Take some pictures of the shrine and continue climbing directly, skipping the crowds. If you enjoy hiking, it‚Äôs a very beautiful climb, but it takes 2~3 hours to get to the top (the wild animals usually keep away from the path, but be careful with them anyway) https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3915.html
- Start early at the Kiyomizudera (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3901.html), maybe get a monk write a goshuin for you, then head to Higashiyama (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3959.html) and walk around, buy souvenirs, get something to eat, maybe rent a yukata or do some traditional pottery lessons, don‚Äôt miss the Yasaka Pagoda
- Definitely skip the Kinkakuji, it‚Äôs a tourist trap with nothing really interesting to see or do
- Make sure to visit a tea house and drink some matcha with wagashi (traditional Japanese sweets); you don‚Äôt really need to book the whole tea ceremony unless you really want to, there are many places where you can just arrive and get some tea (https://japancheapo.com/food-and-drink/matcha-guide-kyoto/)
- Try matcha everything! Ice cream, latte, chocolate, sweets, whatever you want!
- Sample some street food at the Nishiki market (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3931.html)
- Don‚Äôt miss visiting Gion, specially at night! Start at Potoncho, then walk down the Main Street checking souvenirs, take some pictures of the Minamiza Theater (and definitely go watch a kabuki play if you can! https://www.insidekyoto.com/kabuki-kyotos-minamiza-theater), until you arrive at the Yasaka shrine; walk around a bit, then turn around and instead of going through the main street, explore the small and narrow alleyways, you may have luck and catch a glimpse of a geisha or a maiko (just don‚Äôt take pictures of them). Note: don‚Äôt plan to eat in Gion unless it‚Äôs a chain store such as a Starbucks or a Coffee Maruyama, anything else will be either extremely exclusive (the kind that needs a letter of introduction) or a tourist trap.
- One of the places I love the most in Kyoto is the Kuramadera temple (https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/kyoto/temples-shrines/kurama-dera-kyoto), it‚Äôs unknown to most tourists (even Japanese) so it‚Äôs always quiet. It‚Äôs a small hike (less than 1 hour), alternatively you can take the funicular for a small fee.

## Tokyo:
- Meiji Jingu shrine in the Yoyogi park (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3002.html)
- Sensoji temple is usually super crowded, but it‚Äôs worth it to check the souvenirs in the shops in front of the temple. You can get some custom omamori as well („ÅäÂÆà„Çä, small amulets with specific functions) even from vending machines, I have one with Rilakkuma. You can also visit at night after closing hours, the area is open to the public and gets a chill vibe when it‚Äôs empty (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3001.html)
- National Museum of Nature and Science in Ueno has a very relaxing and immersive vibe (if you played Animal Crossing: New Horizons, it‚Äôs kinda like the island museum); don‚Äôt forget to take a picture with the huge whale statue in front of it (https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/museums/national-museum-of-nature-and-science)
- Shimokitazawa is home to several trendy cafes, usually very popular with young people (https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/guide/NTJnews0024-en/); for example there‚Äôs a Ghibli cafe that‚Äôs very cute (https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/shirohiges-cream-puff-factory/40958)
- The Ghibli museum is great, but usually you need to buy a reservation at least 1 month before
- Ginza has a nice mix of dirty-looking bars below railways and upscale rooftops, with a variety of nice restaurants around (look for one of the many Godzilla statues, https://tokyocheapo.com/entertainment/museums-and-exhibitions/tokyo-godzilla-statues/)
- Odaiba is a must-see, specially at night due to the many ‚Äúillumination‚Äù places (beautiful, colored lights), you should take the monorail at least once going or coming back from there (take the first car, since it has no conductor you can see everything from a huge front window), there‚Äôs a charming tiny beach and a pier with a nice view from the Rainbow Bridge, don‚Äôt miss the Fuji TV headquarters building turning on the light show (https://tokyocheapo.com/place/fuji-television-building/), check the giant moving Gundam robot in front of the DiverCity Tokyo Plaza (https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/unicorn-gundam-statue-in-odaiba/41317), sample some nice food at the Takoyaki Museum, a themed food court where you can get different styles of takoyaki from all around Japan (https://appetiteforjapan.com/2016/06/18/odaiba-takoyaki-museum-a-street-food-theme-park/) in the DECKS Tokyo Beach, on the same floor as the Takoyaki Museum, stroll around and see several nostalgia-themed stores and attractions, with old-style arcades, candy shops and toys, maybe take a boat to/from Asakusa (https://www.gotokyo.org/en/story/walks-and-tours/waterfront/take-the-water-bus-from-asakusa-to-odaiba/index.html)
- There are two Disney parks near Tokyo, a Disneyland (very similar to the one in Paris), and an exclusive one that only exists in Japan: Tokyo DisneySea (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3016_sea.html). It‚Äôs a mediterranean-themed park full of water attractions, super popular during summer.

## Kamakura:
A little Kyoto-like town near Tokyo with beach/surf vibes, many Okinawa and Hawaii-themed hotels and restaurants.

- Skip the giant Buddha, the one in Nara us *much* more impressive.
- Follow the Komachi-dori street (and check small shops and street vendors) until Tsurugaoka Hachimangu (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3102.html).
- Hasedera has a nice view of the city and the skyline (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3101.html).
- Kenchoji (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3104.html) is a beautiful shrine with a nice small hike of about 1h that gives a nice top view of the city.
- Zeniarai Benten (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3111.html) is a curious shrine, a bit isolated, where people say that if you wash your money in a spring there, it will double.
- Just walking around and stopping to see smaller shrines and temples is also great.
- 1 full day should be more than enough.

## Enoshima:
A small island close to Kamakura, also a day-trip from Tokyo, near some nice beaches, connected to the mainland with a long bridge that has nice view of the Mount Fuji, it has pretty much a single path beginning to end, with a lot of super fresh seafood and lots of climbing.

- Sample some seafood at the smaller street crossing the main street before starting the climb
- If you get tired of climbing, buy tickets to the escalators
- The Sea Candle tower usually has a wait time but you can get a number and check in the website, so use that time to relax and maybe eat something (https://www.guidoor.jp/en/places/5467)
- The main attraction are the Iwaya caves, they say a dragon used to terrorize the villages in the area when the Enoshima island erupted as the home to the Benzaiten goddess, then the dragon asked her in marriage and she accepted as long as he stopped eating children and helped protect the land instead (https://donnykimball.com/enoshima-2f4a58d547ce); the caves themselves have a solemn vibe, with a statue of the dragon that makes a thunder noise when you clap your hands, and it ends in a spectacular view of the Mount Fuji (http://www.unmissablejapan.com/underground/iwaya-caves)
- End the day at the Enoshima Island Spa to rest your feet and recover stamina (https://www.japan-experience.com/all-about-japan/kamakura/onsen-public-baths/enoshima-island-spa); if you‚Äôre already hungry again there are some nice food trucks nearby.
- 1 full day, arrive early and be prepared to return exhausted.

## Yokohama:
The second most populous city in Japan, is a short 30 minutes train trip from Tokyo. All the main attractions are really close to one another, near the harbor. If you played Yakuza: Like a Dragon, the game events take place there.

- Minato Mirai (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3200.html) is really beautiful, check the colorful ferris wheel after it gets dark, have some fun in the amusement park, stroll around the area, take some pictures of the Nippon Maru (https://www.yokohamastation.com/nippon-maru-museum-ship/), then walk through the Kishamichi Promenade, absorbing the atmosphere (it‚Äôs said to be one of the most romantic places in Japan), until you get to the World Porters (https://www.yokohamajapan.com/things-to-do/detail.php?bbid=200) shopping mall where you can eat Hawaiian food and with some luck watch a hula show. After that, head to the Red Brick Warehouse (akarenga, https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/1598/), walk around and take some time to see the ships.
- You may want to buy a ticket to the top of the Landmark Tower (https://www.yokohamastation.com/yokohama-landmark-tower/) and take some pictures from above.
- The Cup Noodles Museum (https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3212.html) is a very popular attraction, you can even make your own custom cup noodles! Also you can buy some silly souvenirs.
- There are multiple boat tours, including some with all-you-can-drink option (https://www.simonearmer.com/boat-tour-of-yokohama-bay/).
